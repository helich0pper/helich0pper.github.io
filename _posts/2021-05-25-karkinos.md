# Dependencies
* Any server capable of hosting PHP
* Tested with PHP 7.4.9
* Tested with Python 3.8 <br>
  Make sure it is in your path as: <br>
    Windows: ```python```<br>
    Linux: ```python3```<br>
    If it is not, please change the commands in ```includes/pid.php```.
* Pip3
* Raspberry Pi Zero friendly :) (crack hashes at your own risk)

# Installing
This installation guide assumes you have all the dependencies. A Wiki page with troubleshooting steps can be found <a href="https://helich0pper.github.io/karkinos/" target="_blank">here</a>.
## Linux/BSD
A video going through these steps can be found [here](https://youtu.be/9LJpzxbm3oU) <br>
1. ```git clone https://github.com/helich0pper/Karkinos.git```
2. ```cd Karkinos```
3. ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
4. ```cd wordlists && unzip passlist.zip```
You can also unzip it manually using file explorer. Just make sure passlist.txt is in **wordlists** directory.
5. ```Make sure you have write privileges for db/main.db```
6. Enable ```extension=sqlite3``` in your php.ini file. You will also need to install it using ```sudo apt-get install php7.0-sqlite3```. **Replace "7.0" with your PHP version!** ```php --version```<br>
Note: MySQLi is used to store statistics such as the total number of cracked hashes.
7. Thats it! Now just host it using your preferred web server **that supports multithreading** eg. Apache Server or Nginx. <br>
   Warning: Using the built in web server ```php -S 127.0.0.1:8888``` in the Karkinos directory uses a **single thread**. You will only be able to use 1 module at a time! (it may stall until the task is complete) <br> <br>
**Important: using port 5555, 5556, or 5557 will conflict with the Modules** <br>
If you insist on using these ports, change the ```PORT``` value in: 
- ```/bin/Server/app.py Line 87```
- ```/bin/Busting/app.py Line 155```
- ```/bin/PortScan/app.py Line 128```
## Windows
1. ```git clone https://github.com/helich0pper/Karkinos.git```
2. ```cd Karkinos```
3. ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
4. ```cd wordlists && unzip passlist.zip``` <br>
You can also unzip it manually using file explorer. Just make sure passlist.txt is in **wordlists** directory.
5. ```Make sure you have write privileges for db/main.db```
6. Enable ```extension=php_sqlite3.dll``` in your php.ini file. Refer to the installation page [here](https://www.php.net/manual/en/sqlite3.installation.php).<br>
Note: MySQLi is used to store statistics such as the total number of cracked hashes.

# Linux Troubleshooting
<a href="https://twitter.com/helich0pper" target="_blank">Contact me</a> if you are still facing issues. I will frequently update this post if any new bugs/issues are <a href="https://github.com/helich0pper/Karkinos/issues" target="_blank">reported</a>.

#### Statistics not displaying or returning an SQLite error
- Make sure the database exists as ```Karkinos/db/main.db```
- Add ```extension=mysqli``` to the end of your ```php.ini``` file. <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.sqlite3.php" target="_blank">Learn more</a>.
- Check your PHP version using ```php --version```. <br> Then install SQLite with ```apt-get install php7.4-sqlite``` (replace "7.4" with your version). <a href="https://www.getastra.com/kb/knowledgebase/how-to-install-sqlite-for-php-on-my-apache-nginx-server/" target="_blank">Learn more</a>.
- Restart your web server after any change.


#### Hash cracking not completing
It may take a bit longer for lower-end systems to crack a hash. If you believe it is indeed stuck, try the following:
- Make sure the wordlist is unpacked. Navigate to ```Karkinos/wordlists/``` and unzip ```passlist.zip```.
- Make sure you have write privileges for ```Karkinos/db/main.db```

#### Valid hash is "unknown"
- Make sure the password list you are cracking with has **read** permissions enabled for the web server. <br> Default wordlist location: ```Karkinos/wordlists/passlist.txt```.

#### Modules not starting
- Verify you have Python 3 installed. Run ```apt-get install python3``` in your terminal to install it.
- Verify the commands in ```Karkinos/includes/pid.php``` are in your systems PATH.
- Install the requirements in the ```Karkinos/requirements.txt``` file.<br> Use: ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```.
